# drag-select-demo

JavaScript drag-select [demo](https://alttiri.github.io/drag-select-demo/).

It's not a library, but this demo can be used as a starting point if you need to implement your own drag-select functional on a site.

See [`index.js`](https://github.com/AlttiRi/drag-select-demo/blob/master/index.js) for the code.
